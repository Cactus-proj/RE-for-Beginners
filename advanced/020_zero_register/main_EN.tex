\section{Zero register}

x86 architecture lacks zero register, unlike MIPS and ARM.
However, it's often a case, when a compiler assigns a zero to a register, that will hold it upon the function's exit.

This is a case of Mahjong game from Windows 7 x86.
Zeroed EBX is used to initialize local variables, to pass zero argument into other functions and to compare values against it.
