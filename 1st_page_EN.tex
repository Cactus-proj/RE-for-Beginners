In 1988 Jim Reuter wrote a VAX-assembly-to-C decompiler:

\begin{lstlisting}
WHY I WROTE IT:

To decompile Peter Langston's EMPIRE game and other goodies into source
form.  This was desired because I wanted to port the games to VMS and
to fix some bugs in the games.
\end{lstlisting}

Read more about it:

\href{http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/DecompDecompiler}{2}.

Now, in order to understand this compiler better, I seek Peter Langston's EMPIRE game from 1980's.
Did anyone hear about it?

Like in IDA.
Maybe, using JavaScript.
Are there any mature open-source solutions?
