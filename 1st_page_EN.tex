\textbf{Student enrollment}

As an experiment, I can try to teach programming (but NOT reverse engineering and NOT infosec). With a strong geeky bias towards theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics and everything around it. No matter what your age age, education and background. Free of charge so far (in demo version mode), in my spare time, remotely.

Please send me your source codes which you are most proud of: \EMAILS{},
so I could measure your level of experience. Please also mention your age, education/work and topics you would like to study.

My dear readers! From time to time, I have questions, I don't know who (or where) to ask.
Or I'm just lazy...
Can you please help me?

I have a 2TB HDD that is constantly busy/noisy.
Even if no OS booted!
That drives me crazy.
A strange thing -- when I turn on "long" SMART test (\verb|smartctl --test=long /dev/sda|),
it is almost silent, but for a ~5 hours.
When test finish, the HDD is constantly noisy again.
While everything is fine in SMART info.
The HDD is new.
Maybe this is a kind of maintenance I should just wait for the end of?
Nothing suspicious in SMART info: \url{https://pastebin.com/5eFePXgG}.

I've got a huge graph, for example, $10^6$ nodes (vertices).
I want to visualize it somehow, so that a user would navigate it using mouse.
Clicked on link (edge) and moved to another node (vertex).
Like in IDA.
Maybe, using JavaScript.
Are there any mature open-source solutions?

Do you remember ``The Incredible Machine'' videogame for DOS?
Do you know about Rube Goldberg machines?
What can be used today for simulating them?
Some kind of physics engine, maybe?
